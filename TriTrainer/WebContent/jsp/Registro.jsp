							Operators make no claims that the Content on the Website is
							appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States.
							Access to the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in
							certain countries. If you access the Website from outside the
							United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for
							compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. The provisions of
							the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
							Goods will not apply to these Terms. A party may give notice to

							provision. Section headings are for reference purposes only and

							arising out of or related to this Agreement or User's use of the
							Website must be brought in the courts of Belgium, and you consent
